I am a full-time lab manager of the [Chatter Lab](https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, working with [Dr. Marisa Casillas](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/marisa-casillas). Here at the Chatter Lab, Iâ€™m involved in projects investigating the co-development of interactional and linguistic competence in children through experimental and observational methods.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Delphine Dahan](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/delphine-dahan) at the University of Pennsylvania to study how communicative goals drive the interpretation of utterances in everyday conversation.

My primary research interest is in the <span style="color:#517e0d">development of pragmatic reasoning</span> in the context of naturalistic language production and comprehension.
